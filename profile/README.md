## Overview  

**Amadeus Pro** is a fully-featured multi-track audio editor for macOS designed to meet the needs of musicians, sound designers, and audio engineers. With a balance of simplicity and professional functionality, Amadeus Pro provides everything required for recording, editing, mastering, and restoring audio with precision and efficiency.  

The program supports a wide range of formats and offers advanced tools for spectral editing, real-time effects, and batch processing. Users can record multiple tracks simultaneously, fine-tune each layer with sample-level accuracy, and export projects in various professional-grade audio formats. Amadeus Pro’s powerful audio restoration tools also make it ideal for digitizing vinyl records and cleaning up old recordings.  

Unlike basic audio editors, Amadeus Pro integrates professional workflows such as crossfades, normalization, noise reduction, and equalization filters. Its intuitive waveform visualization and non-destructive editing system allow seamless experimentation without risk to your original audio. The built-in batch processor enables users to apply effects or convert large audio libraries automatically, saving valuable time.  

Optimized for macOS, Amadeus Pro takes advantage of Apple’s Core Audio and multicore performance for smooth, low-latency editing. From podcast production to soundtrack mastering, it’s a versatile tool trusted by creators who demand both flexibility and professional-grade quality in their workflow.
